# Snake
 Simple Snake game in Java

# Instructions
 This game compiles in OpenJDK 16 using the "Main" class as the starting point.
 I have also included a compiled jar file.

# Choices Made
 This game uses a self-made event listener to re-shift focus.
 This is only because I wanted to try implementing one.
 It is only used to request focus on the main game frame - which can be done using a parent lookup function instead.
